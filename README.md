# MyStegProgram

WINNDOWS USER READ BOTTOM PORTION AS WELL

I wanted to create a User Friendly Steg Program, so I did! 

Here's what's needed to get started. 

Open your terminal and cd into the directory where you downloaded the files. 

Don't worry you can just download the "downloadMe.zip" file and unpack everything in the repository. 

From there run ./setup.sh

And it will just work! 

Use the mute button to mute Honeypie. 

Place your file to hide in the first box, and your cover up image in the second.

Then make sure you remember any passoword you set so that you can decrypt later on. 

Have fun! 

For windows, manually download the .bat file and place it inside the unzipped folder before running.
